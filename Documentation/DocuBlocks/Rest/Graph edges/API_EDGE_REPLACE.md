@brief replaces an edge

@RESTHEADER{PUT /_api/document/{document-handle}#replaceEdge, replaces an edge}

@RESTALLBODYPARAM{edge,json,required}
A JSON representation of the new edge data.

@RESTURLPARAMETERS

@RESTURLPARAM{document-handle,string,required}
The handle of the edge document.

@RESTQUERYPARAMETERS

@RESTQUERYPARAM{waitForSync,boolean,optional}
Wait until edge document has been synced to disk.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{rev,string,optional}
You can conditionally replace an edge document based on a target revision id by
using the *rev* query parameter.

@RESTQUERYPARAM{policy,string,optional}
To control the update behavior in case there is a revision mismatch, you
can use the *policy* parameter (see below).

@RESTHEADERPARAMETERS

@RESTHEADERPARAM{If-Match,string,optional}
You can conditionally replace an edge document based on a target revision id by
using the *if-match* HTTP header.

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Completely updates (i.e. replaces) the edge document identified by *document-handle*.
If the edge document exists and can be updated, then a *HTTP 201* is returned
and the "ETag" header field contains the new revision of the edge document.

If the new edge document passed in the body of the request contains the
*document-handle* in the attribute *_id* and the revision in *_rev*,
these attributes will be ignored. Only the URI and the "ETag" header are
relevant in order to avoid confusion when using proxies. 
**Note**: The attributes
*_from* and *_to* of an edge are immutable and cannot be updated either.

Optionally, the query parameter *waitForSync* can be used to force
synchronization of the edge document replacement operation to disk even in case
that the *waitForSync* flag had been disabled for the entire collection.
Thus, the *waitForSync* query parameter can be used to force synchronization
of just specific operations. To use this, set the *waitForSync* parameter
to *true*. If the *waitForSync* parameter is not specified or set to
*false*, then the collection's default *waitForSync* behavior is
applied. The *waitForSync* query parameter cannot be used to disable
synchronization for collections that have a default *waitForSync* value
of *true*.

The body of the response contains a JSON object with the information about
the handle and the revision. The attribute *_id* contains the known
*document-handle* of the updated edge document, *_key* contains the key which 
uniquely identifies a document in a given collection, and the attribute *_rev*
contains the new document revision.

If the edge document does not exist, then a *HTTP 404* is returned and the
body of the response contains an error document.

There are two ways for specifying the targeted revision id for
conditional replacements (i.e. replacements that will only be executed if
the revision id found in the database matches the revision id specified
in the request):
- specifying the target revision in the *rev* URL query parameter
- specifying the target revision in the *if-match* HTTP header

Specifying a target revision is optional, however, if done, only one of the
described mechanisms must be used (either the *rev* query parameter or the
*if-match* HTTP header).
Regardless which mechanism is used, the parameter needs to contain the target
revision id as returned in the *_rev* attribute of an edge document or
by an HTTP *etag* header.

For example, to conditionally replace an edge document based on a specific revision
id, you can use the following request:

- PUT /_api/document/*document-handle*?rev=*etag*

If a target revision id is provided in the request (e.g. via the *etag* value
in the *rev* URL query parameter above), ArangoDB will check that
the revision id of the edge document found in the database is equal to the target
revision id provided in the request. If there is a mismatch between the revision
id, then by default a *HTTP 412* conflict is returned and no replacement is
performed.

The conditional update behavior can be overridden with the *policy* URL query parameter:

- PUT /_api/document/*document-handle*?policy=*policy*

If *policy* is set to *error*, then the behavior is as before: replacements
will fail if the revision id found in the database does not match the target
revision id specified in the request.

If *policy* is set to *last*, then the replacement will succeed, even if the
revision id found in the database does not match the target revision id specified
in the request. You can use the *last* *policy* to force replacements.

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
is returned if the edge document was replaced successfully and *waitForSync* was
*true*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{202}
is returned if the edge document was replaced successfully and *waitForSync* was
*false*.

@RESTRETURNCODE{400}
is returned if the body does not contain a valid JSON representation of an edge
document or if applied to a non-edge collection. The response body contains an
error document in this case.

@RESTRETURNCODE{404}
is returned if the collection or the edge document was not found

@RESTRETURNCODE{412}
is returned if a "If-Match" header or *rev* is given and the found
document has a different version. The response will also contain the found
document's current revision in the *_rev* attribute. Additionally, the
attributes *_id* and *_key* will be returned.
